    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes is typically used when the features are binary & it takes only two values, 0 & 1. It is commonly used in text classification tasks, where each feature represents the presence or absence of a particular word in a document. In Bernoulli Naive Bayes, each feature is modeled as a binary random variable, with the assumption that each feature is conditionally independent given the class. This means that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the probability of the presence or absence of any other feature. The algorithm then calculates the conditional probability of each class given the presence or absence of each feature, using Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes, on the other hand, is used when the features are discrete & it takes some non-negative integer values. It is commonly used in text classification tasks, where each feature represents the count of a particular word in a document. In Multinomial Naive Bayes, each feature is modeled as a multinomial random variable, with the assumption that each feature is conditionally independent given the class. This means that the count of one feature does not affect the probability of the count of any other feature. The algorithm then calculates the conditional probability of each class given the count of each feature, using Bayes' theorem.\n",

    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as text classification. It is a variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm that assumes that the features are binary or Boolean, indicating whether a particular feature is present or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of missing values in the input data, Bernoulli Naive Bayes handles them by simply ignoring the missing values and treating them as if they were not present in the data. This is because the algorithm assumes that the features are independent of each other, and therefore the absence of a particular feature does not affect the probability of the presence of another feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the presence or absence of certain features can have a significant impact on the classification accuracy of the algorithm. Therefore, it is recommended to handle missing values in the input data by imputing correct values, such as the mean or median value of that desired feature before applying the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm."

    "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification tasks. The algorithm can be extended to handle multiple classes by using the \"one-vs-all\" or \"one-vs-rest\" strategy, where the algorithm trains multiple binary classifiers, one for each class, and then combines their results to make the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"one-vs-all\" strategy, for each class, the algorithm considers all instances of that class as positive, as well as, negative examples. It then trains a binary classifier for each class using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. During prediction, the algorithm applies each classifier to the input instance and selects the class with the highest probability as the final prediction.\n",

    "Alternatively, in the \"one-vs-rest\" strategy, the algorithm considers each class separately and treats it as the positive, as well as, negative class.
